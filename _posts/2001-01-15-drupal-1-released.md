excerpt: "Dries Buytaert shares the initial release of his 'dormitory bulletin board'. It includes 18 files that are called modules. It features a hook system where modules interact with each other and the core framework. On this very day, Wikipedia is also born. Had that happened 6 months later, it would probably be a Drupal site!"

The excerpt is pulled automatically from above the `<!-- more -->` tag, unless there is a custom `excerpt` line in the front matter.

I'll write another line for a longer post.

We could also completely ignore this part, but would be a good place to put links, images, and another reminisces.
