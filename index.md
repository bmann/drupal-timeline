This is an example of building a JSON "api" out of Jekyll markdown posts. This makes it easier for people to just write markdown posts, and the system can generate correct JSON files.

We also conveniently get a whole linkable blog post, where we can have an HTML "blog post" of each piece of JSON data, too.

Here's the Drupal Timeline JSON:

* [/api/timeline.json](/api/timeline.json)
